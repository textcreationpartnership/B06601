            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Thomas Waites Caſe, <hi>A Condemned Priſoner in the Tower.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THat He was much diſſatisfied with the Armies proceedings, in Impriſoning divers Members of Parliament, in the year, 1648.</p>
            <p>That he went down ſoon after to his own houſe, 80 miles diſtant from <hi>London,</hi> and came not up again untill he was ſummoned ſeveral times, under pain of Sequeſtration and Expulſion, and did not come up untill the day before that horrid ſentence was given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, and then knew not what it was that he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come up for.</p>
            <p>That he was none of the Contrivers, or Law-makers, for ſetting up that Unwarrantable Court, for Tryal of the King, but was abſent all the while.</p>
            <p>That he never knew himſelf to be one of that Court, untill his name was called, at which he was amazed.</p>
            <p>That he was trapan'd by <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Ireton</hi> to come out of the Houſe, and then forced by them into the Court, and when the King deſired to be heard by his Lords and Commons in the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted-Chamber, He, with ſome others deſired he might be heard, which cauſed the Court to withdraw into the Court of Wards; then <hi>Cromwel</hi> rebuked thoſe that were the occaſion of it with many reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which made all men ſilent, ſeeing it was to no purpoſe to ſpeak, whereupon he returned no more into the Court, but ſtayed behind in the Croud.</p>
            <p>That he ſigned not the warrant for Execution, nor any writing tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto until after that horrid fact was committed, but ſome time after was forced by <hi>Cromwel</hi> to ſign a writing with others (not knowing what was contained in it) ſaying we ſhould not ſlip out ſo, and from that time to his death, he looked upon him with an evil eye. That he never bought any of the Kings Lands or Goods, only a finall Fee-Farm rent that he paid out of his own Lands.</p>
            <p>That he was put out of all Authority by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for aſſiſting the Kings Friends, in helping them to their juſt dues, and being ſerviceable to them.</p>
            <p>That he was a great Sufferer under <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for oppoſing his Tyranny.</p>
            <p>That he nearly eſcaped Decimation, for offering himſelf to be bound for ſome of his Countrymen, that were Decimated.</p>
            <p>That he would not ſuffer any of the Kings Friends to be Impriſoned, or their houſes ſearched, in the year 1659. when he was in power.</p>
            <p>That he never took the Oath of Abjuration againſt his now Majeſty, but alwaies oppoſed it in his Station, and glad he was at the reſtauration of his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>That he came in upon the Proclamation.</p>
